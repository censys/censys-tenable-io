# Censys Tenable.io Integration
v1.0, 2021-03-03
:toc: preamble
:toc-title: In this guide:

The Censys Tenable.io integration sits between the Censys Attack Surface Management platform and your Tenable instance.

The integration queries the platform's logbook API and feeds hosts into Tenable's vulnerability management tool.

## Installation Considerations

The Censys Tenable.io integration is packaged to run in a Docker container, which can be deployed on a variety of infrastructure types. Managing containers is the responsibility of the user. 

This integrations works with Tenable.io instances, not Tenable.se.
